Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)
==============

The DRI is a temporary role which designates the person responsible for the full engineering lifecycle and successful delivery of a product initiative. A good way to think of this role is a technical project manager who is part of the engineering team building a given feature.

- The DRI should be identified early in the product life cycle of a product initiative so that they can answer technical questions or offer other guidance during the problem definition, ideation, and product review stages.
- The tangible work of the DRI begins once the product initiative / Jira Epic reaches the engineering team for implementation.
- The DRI will play a major role in planning, developing, and deploying a product initiative from an engineering perspective.
- The DRI is empowered to make decisions while keeping others informed. They should often use the phrase “I intend to…” rather than seeking permission on next steps.

## DRI Responsibilities Overview:

1. Determine, from a technical/implementation standpoint, what needs to be done to deliver on the AC's defined in the Jira Epic. This could include consulting with a Tech Lead on technical approaches, identifying other teams and individuals that need to be involved, and talking with the Product Manager or subject matter experts to answer any open questions.
2. Determine a plan for development. This includes identifying dependencies, creating an iterative plan that may include shippable milestones, and determining the necessary order of tasks.
3. Create tickets (as part of the Jira Epic) for all tasks that need to be completed to deliver this product initiative. Coordinate with others teams to ensure tickets are complete.
4. Ensure the tickets are presented during grooming sessions and facilitate discussions to ensure the tickets are properly groomed.
5. Coordinate with the Product Manager on when that work can be or needs to be done and slotted into the roadmap.
6. Ensure the successful delivery of the product initiative. This could include leading the way on identifying roadblocks, updating the plan when a shift in approach is needed, or identifying work that was previously unaccounted for. Communication with product, design, or other teams is very important here.

**NOTE:** The DRI is not required or expected to perform all tasks or make all technical decisions alone but should ensure that these things happen. The DRI will collaborate with their team, delegate tasks as needed, and serve as a facilitator throughout the engineering lifecycle of the product initiative.
