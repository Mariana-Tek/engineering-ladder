Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)
==============

*The DRI is a temporary role which designates the person responsible for the full engineering lifecycle and successful delivery of a product initiative. A good way to think of this role is a technical project manager who is part of the engineering team building a given feature. The DRI is not required or expected to perform all tasks or make all technical decisions alone but should ensure that these things happen. The DRI will collaborate with their team, delegate tasks as needed, and serve as a facilitator throughout the engineering lifecycle of the product initiative.*

### Accountabilities
- The DRI will answer technical questions and offer guidance during the problem definition, ideation, and product review stages.
- When the Epic is finalized, the DRI will facilitate the successful planning, development, and deployment of a product initiative from an engineering team perspective.
- The DRI will keep others informed, and is empowered to make decisions leading with “I intend to…” rather than seeking permission at each step.
- The DRI will ensure closure of the product initiative, including but not limited to leading retrospectives, monitoring the success of the feature, and handoff to relevant stakeholders.

### Responsibilities:

- Determine what needs to be done to deliver on the acceptance criteria defined in the Epic. This could include:

    - Identify other teams and individuals that need to be involved
    - Coordinate with the Product Manager (or subject matter experts) to understand the business value of the product initiative
    - Seek to understand time and resource constraints from technical + non-technical stakeholders
    - Work with the Product Manager to ensure the product initiative is appropriately added to the roadmap
    
- Determine, from a technical implementation standpoint, a plan for development:

    - Consult with a Tech Lead on technical approaches 
    - Identify dependencies and potential for risks
    - Create an iterative and actionable plan (i.e., identify shippable milestones, determine MVP or phasing approach, etc.)
    - Determining the necessary order of tasks
    
- Create tickets (as part of the Epic) for all tasks that need to be completed to deliver this product initiative. 

- Ensure the tickets are presented during grooming sessions and facilitate discussions to ensure the tickets are properly groomed.

- Ensure the successful delivery of the product initiative:
    - Lead the way on identifying roadblocks
    - Update the plan when a shift in approach is needed and communicate to stakeholders
    - Notify product, design, or other teams of relevant changes as they arise
    - Communicate metrics for success to development, product, or other teams
