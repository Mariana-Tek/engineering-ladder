Technical Lead
==============

## The Technical Lead is accountable for the engineering approach and code quality the team delivers

*A Technical Lead is a formal role that is added to an engineerâ€™s normal responsibilities. Becoming a TL does not result in a change in title, and people can switch in and out of this role on different teams based on what is the best fit for the team and individual at that time.*

*Technical Lead is a leadership role. The technical success & output of their team is more important than the code they themselves write.*

### Accountabilities

It's the responsibility of the TL to ensure all of the following:

* *The technical solution that the team chooses efficiently solves the problem*
* *The team breaks features and tech debt into vertical slices that add value and avoids big, upfront architecture*
* *Shipped code quality is high*
* *UX performance is high*
* *Team adherence to good engineering practices (like CI & unit tests)*
* *The team addresses tech debt before it affects their ability to deliver*

### Responsibilities

#### Goals & planning

* Work with PM/EM/Designer to create key results for teams
* Work with PM/Designer to suggest hypotheses & ways to validate them
* Work with PM/Designer to discuss approach & whale scale (t-shirt sizes) of larger features - look for ways to break into smaller pieces that add value & discuss risks & mitigations
* Ensure the team understands how the sprint & the stories in it ladder up into OKRs & the company priorities
* Lead necessary tradeoff decisions with the PM, Designer, and team

#### Sprint coordination

* Manage technical WIP & help with/raise blockers
* Ensure engineers have clear focus
* Ensure engineers pause to ask questions as necessary

#### Tech direction

* Advise on which tech debt the team needs to address
* Role model and mentor incremental improvement strategies
* Guide team in balance of addressing tech debt vs new features
* Prioritize chores in the backlog
* Ensure high quality architecture & technical approach of features
* Guide team towards the simplest solution
* Act as tie breaker if necessary
* Ensure team is breaking features into vertical slices that add value rather than doing big upfront architecture
* Ensure code quality, stability & UX speed as appropriate (experiments & prototypes may have different standards)
* Coach & mentor engineers in technical development & good engineering practices

#### Process

* Works with EM, PM & designer to evolve Agile approach to fit team and project needs.
* Work with PM to ensure epics & stories have a clear goal, are user focused & have clear acceptance criteria
* Work with PM to ensure Stories are pre-refined & ready before team refinement
