## Introduction

The Mariana Tek Engineering Ladder defines the responsibilities and expectations of people working at various levels within the engineering team. It exists as a rubric for hiring, a guide for engineers seeking excellence and advancement, and a framework for managers to evaluate performance and identify candidates for promotion.

Like many engineering teams, we outline two paths for career advancement: the management track and the technical track. Engineers pursuing the management track (["Managers"](#managers)) are interested in managing people and teams. Engineers pursuing the technical track (["Makers"](#makers)) are interested in honing their technical expertise and shaping the technical direction of the company.

Framed another way by the engineering team at [Chartbeat](https://engineering.chartbeat.com/2015/06/05/engineering-ladders/), the difference between Makers and Managers is how they answer this question:

> “Do I want to build bigger and better systems, or do I want to manage bigger and better teams?”

Every engineer starts their career as a maker. As you work your way from [Engineer I](makers/engineer_i.md) to [Engineer II](makers/engineer_ii.md) to [Senior Engineer](makers/senior_engineer.md), you are primarily focused on expanding your technical knowledge and mastering the skills required of a professional software engineer. When you're ready to move beyond Senior Engineer, you have the opportunity to switch to the management track.

Neither track is superior to the other, and engineers will often switch between them as they move through their careers.

## For New Employees

If you are new to the team, please don't panic while reading the expectations for engineers at your level! Our codebase is huge and complicated, and it's normal to spend 6-12 months on the team before you feel like you know the lay of the land. You will contribute code before then, of course! We do a lot of pair programming and skill-sharing during the onboarding process, and you'll start off with small, well-defined tickets to build up your confidence. Ramping up to your full capabilities will take a while -- and that's okay!

## Shared Expectations

These behaviors are expected of engineers at all levels:

- Treat everyone with empathy and respect.
- Seek feedback proactively. Accept it graciously.
- Be mindful and empathetic in communicating with others.
- Handle conflict constructively. Assume best intent.
- Learn from failure by admitting mistakes and sharing what you learned.
- Amplify and celebrate the contributions of your teammates.

## Glossary

### Example Behaviors

The "Example Behaviors" section is meant to elucidate the high-level expectations outlined for each position. It is **not a checklist** that you must complete to move up the ladder. 

Think of it like the code snippets included in software documentation to illustrate how a particular package or method or syntax *can* be used in different scenarios, not how it *must* be used. The intention is to inspire and clarify, not mandate.

Again, just to be super clear: **"Example Behaviors" are not requirements.**
